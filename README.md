ðŸ›’ Discount Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.
It only applies the discount if it is 20% or higher â€” otherwise, you just pay the original price.

## Features

1. Takes user input for price and discount percentage.

2. Applies discount only when it's 20% or more.

3.  Returns the final price or the original price.

4. Handles invalid input with error messages.

## How It Works

The program asks you to enter:

The original price of the item.

The discount percentage.

If the discount is >= 20%, the program reduces the price.

If the discount is < 20%, no discount is applied.

The final price is printed.
